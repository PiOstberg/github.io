Beetlebot is a 4 level dungeon crawler. It was our first game project at PlaygroundSquad and made in the game engine TenGine.  
I was tasked with building most of the core systems powering the game, such as the physics, collision detection, enemy pathfinding, as well as providing platform support for the PlayStation 5.
